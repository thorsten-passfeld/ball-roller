# ball-roller
A more or less simple project in Unity3D (from 2016) that generates a random playing area equipped with dynamically scaled railings.
You can steer a glass ball through the course, similar to the famous game classic "Super Monkey Ball".
Scripts (written in C#) are found under -> ball-roller/Assets/Scripts/
